UberGallery
------------------------------------------------------------------
UberGallery is a simple, yet powerful, PHP photo gallery that will 
basically manage itself for you. UberGallery supports .jpg, .gif and
.png image types, and will automatically creates thumbnails on the fly.
The main feature of this gallery is it automatically outputs XHTML
compliant markup for inclusion on a web page. The UberGallery will also
automatically prune it's thumbnails, so when you delete an image from
the images folder, it will delete the corresponding thumbnail. The
gallery also creates a log file for reference and debugging. The
UberGallery is licensed under the MIT License.

UberGallery also includes dynamic pagination. This allows users with 
larger galleries to split the gallery up into several smaller pages so
visitors can easily browse those pages using a navigation bar below the
gallery. GZip compression is also implemented on the default index.php
file included with the gallery which helps to reduce bandwidth usage
and improves page load times significantly.
